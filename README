A "re-imagining" of James MPT.  Goals that are important to me are:

- Support for multiple hosts in a single script.  This is useful
when there is a restricted interface and a full interface, e.g. 
normal user experience vs. admin tool.  Without this support, a 
single script couldn't test interactions that span the 2 interfaces.

- Variables that can be assigned by server output.  For example,
capturing the UID of a message and subsequently using that value
later in the script, in both client requests and expected server
responses.


Each script is run as a test case
Pre/post scripts?
Integration into ant
users?
hosts 
- defined in ant or script or properties?
- properties wouldn't require changing build.xml for different envs
- should be defined only once
Runner
Parse scripts?
antlib
